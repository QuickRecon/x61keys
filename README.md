# x61keys
A small program to allow the Thinkpad x61 volume and 'ThinkVantage' buttons to be functional under linux.

The volume keys are now functional.

To run just compile main.cpp with the command:
```
make
```
and install with:
```
make install
```

You can set commands to be run when certain buttons are pressed in the config file, by default the volume keys are mapped to their default fuctions in alsa.
